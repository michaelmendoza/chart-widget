## Widget Architecture

### File Structure 
- components: react components 
- libraries:  utility functions that donâ€™t have side effects. (exposed api)
- services:  functions that touch endpoints & communicate with APIs (contains interfaces with default impelmentations for services)
- reducers:  functions that modify state & have side-effects.
- models:  types & classes, if the classes interact with an API, they should make a call to things in services/
- state: the classes & Higher order components necessary to create the context for reducers to use. Should be pretty lightweight. 
- styles: scss styles
